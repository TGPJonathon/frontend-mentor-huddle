## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid & Flex

### What I learned

That I have no idea why display grid & place content: center is not working for me. I also learned that I'm easing back into the CSS groove because I had few issues with this challenge.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about Flexbox & Grid. Also, I want to learn why SVGs can be weird and how to develop more accessible layouts.
